# From Zero to Hero: Building Your First Voice Bot with GPT-4o Real-Time API using Python

Voice technology is transforming how we interact with machines, making conversations with AI feel more natural than ever before. With the public beta release of the Realtime API powered by GPT-4o, developers now have the tools to create low-latency, multimodal voice experiences in their apps, opening up endless possibilities for innovation.

 

Gone are the days when building a voice bot required stitching together multiple models for transcription, inference, and text-to-speech conversion. With the Realtime API, developers can now streamline the entire process with a single API call, enabling fluid, natural speech-to-speech conversations. This is a game-changer for industries like customer support, education, and real-time language translation, where fast, seamless interactions are crucial.

## Key Features

- **Realtime Python Client**: Based off https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta
