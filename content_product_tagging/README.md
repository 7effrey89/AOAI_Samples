## Key Features of AI-Powered Product Catalog Image Search:

- Object Recognition and Tagging: AI algorithms can identify and tag objects within images, providing accurate and consistent categorization of products. This reduces the reliance on manual tagging, ensuring that products are correctly labeled in the catalog.
- Visual Similarity Search: AI enables visual similarity search, allowing users to find products based on visual attributes rather than relying solely on text-based queries. This feature is especially valuable for customers who may struggle to describe a product in words but can easily recognize it visually.
- Enhanced Product Discovery: By understanding the visual characteristics of products, AI facilitates a more sophisticated recommendation system. Customers can discover related or complementary items, leading to increased cross-selling opportunities and a more engaging shopping experience.
